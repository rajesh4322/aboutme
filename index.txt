I came to pursue my Masters in Applied Computer Science for spring 2019 batch at Northwest Missouri State University.

I am from Bengaluru, India. I completed my under graduation from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. And my hobbies are listening music, dancing. 

My future plan is to work as a software developer. By the time this course completes I would like to gain more knowledge in latest technologies and also in programming that can help me to build up my career.

I like Sports.I am a Badminton player.I would love to watch European football (soccer), mostly FC Barcelona matches. My idol is LeBron James (basketball player).
